# Transit-Demand-Forecasting-SQL
I analyzed publicly available data from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to gain valuable insights into urban mobility trends within New York City. 
This dataset, encompassing for-hire vehicles, rideshare apps, and both green and yellow taxis, provided a comprehensive view of the city's transportation ecosystem.
By examining patterns in transportation demand, accessibility, and rider preferences, i identified key trends, such as peak travel times, popular routes, and variations in ride choices across different demographics and geographies.
These findings have the potential to drive impactful changes in urban planning by identifying bottlenecks, optimizing traffic management, and improving transit accessibility. 
For transportation service providers, this analysis can inform strategies to enhance customer experiences, allocate resources effectively, and expand service coverage. 
Overall, my work aims to contribute to a more efficient, equitable, and sustainable transportation network in New York City.
