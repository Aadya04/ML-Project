# Transit-Demand-Forecasting-SQL
I analyzed New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) data to uncover insights into urban mobility trends, focusing on for-hire vehicles, rideshare apps, and green/yellow taxis. The project involved cleaning and validating data, normalizing it into 3NF, and designing a dimensional schema to support analysis of patterns in transportation demand, peak travel times, and rider preferences. Data was processed and hosted on a cloud-based MySQL server using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to enable scalability and team collaboration. My final model centered on a fact_ride table, supported by dimensions for time, location, vehicle, and payment, enabling impactful analyses to optimize traffic management and enhance transit services.
